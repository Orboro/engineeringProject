                <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="color: #2a2a2a">These are difficult times. So let&#8217;s come together and practice some stress reduction and learn some adaptive coping skills. As counterintuitive as it may seem, paying attention to the thoughts, emotions and body sensations that are arising in these scary times may actually help us manage our stress. We can be blindsided by our fears when we constantly push them away. Mindfulness practice is about paying attention to the present moment, whether we like it or not. Mindfulness doesn&#8217;t change the difficult times, it gives the deep roots we need to weather the storm.</span></p>
